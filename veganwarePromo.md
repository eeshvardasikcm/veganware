# veganware promotional guidelines
The essence of vegan lifestyle and the direction that sustainability practices are going will gain benefit from these grassroots style guidelines that I am going to implement.
## GitHub sponsorship guidelines
sponsor my GitHub and I will spend anywhere between 10 to 25% of my sponsorship revenue at local vegan businesses.
## benefits of local vegan businesses
by using local vegan businesses to spend your money and spend your time, you are giving back to those who have given a vision of making vegan lifestyle more available in your local area.
## benefits of sponsoring vegan developers
when you sponsor vegan developers, you are letting them know that you want them to increase their vegan practices.
you are allowing vegan developers to live a more vegan lifestyle by giving them the message that you want to create an economy that is vegan only.
## vegan only economy
in a perfect vegan world, vegans would be purchasing from each other and selling to each other at extremely high percentages compared to their transactions with meat eaters.
### avoiding meat eater economy
grocery stores are actually a very good place to buy produce and vegan foods.
when possible, try to use vegan businesses to buy the products that are available through vegan businesses.
for instance, there are freezer foods that are easier to sell and packaged foods that are easier to be sold by smaller businesses.
you can go to the grocery store's to make your produce purchases,
then try to find directly available vegan sources for some of the other items instead of buying them at the grocery store.
